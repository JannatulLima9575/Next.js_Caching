# Next.js Caching & Rendering

This project is focused on understanding how **Next.js Caching and Rendering** work in real-world applications.  
It demonstrates different rendering strategies, caching mechanisms, and how React Server Components (RSC) improve performance and scalability.

---

## 📌 What This Project Covers

- ✅ Next.js Rendering Strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR)
- ✅ React Client & Server Components
- ✅ React Server Components (RSC) and RSC Payload
- ✅ Next.js Caching Strategies
- ✅ Real-life use cases and practical examples

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### 🔹 Rendering Strategies
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** – Generates HTML on every request
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** – Generates HTML at build time
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** – Rebuilds pages after a specific interval
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** – Rendering happens in the browser

---

### 🔹 React Client & Server Components
- Server Components run on the server and reduce JavaScript sent to the client
- Client Components handle interactivity like state, events, and effects
- Proper separation improves performance and scalability

---

### 🔹 React Server Component (RSC) Payload
- RSC Payload contains serialized data sent from server to client
- Helps hydrate UI efficiently without sending unnecessary JavaScript
- Improves initial load time and overall performance

---

### 🔹 Next.js Caching Strategies
This project demonstrates caching using:
- Static caching
- Dynamic rendering
- Revalidation (ISR)
- Cache control with real-world scenarios

Each strategy is explained with examples to show **when and why** to use it.
